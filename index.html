        <p class="lead mb-4">Background: I have worked in retail for about 2 and a half years now. I have always thrived for a challenge when it came to my job. I seeked for tasks that pushed me to do better and become a better person. I want to expand my experience and work with a bigger team with bigger corporations. Being a part of a business is something I want to pursue and make a career out of. I am still trying to figure out a specific part of business but that is why I apply myself to these different opportunities I am given and give my full attention and effort when given the opportunity. I work well in teams in projects, group work, and in sports as well. I have always enjoyed listening to others ideas and combining each and everyone of them. I get to know my peers and we have fun with what we do while still doing our job; it gives an uplifting atmosphere when giving our job a personality.

Traits and characteristics: Some traits and characteristics I have is Multi-tasking. It can get busy in the environment I work in. For instance, I have worked at McDonalds and some people had called off so I had to multitask because of the amount of people that were coming to get food for the weekend and the amount of employees we had at the time. Time management is a trait I have, coming on time to work is very important as well as getting customers and guests the fastest assistance possible. I am very organized with my work and make sure I have all the correct information with a customer or guest in the job I am working in so if there is an issue I have their contact information. I have great communication skills with my peers, teammates, managers and customers. It is important that everyone is aware of any new changes that have been made or any questions or concerns that I must communicate with my team about.

Goal: My goal is to find a job in the business industry and surround myself with a team who have similar goals to mine in life. I donâ€™t want to just get my dream career but I want to build and connect with my career and achieve my dreams with it. I also want to be able to help my society and environment with my job in any way I can and do more good than harm in this world. Traveling with my job is another dream of mine in which I can apply my knowledge and effort to places that need it. I felt I have succeeded in my job and what I do. Not everyone can say they love the job but my experience is growing as I apply myself to different jobs and find my calling.Becoming a part of a business means becoming a part of a bigger family with many challenges. I know it wonâ€™t be easy but what's the fun in that? Expanding what I already know is good for my future self. Not only do I want more for myself but for the people I love around me who push me and motivate me to do better.
